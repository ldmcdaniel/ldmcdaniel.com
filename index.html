            <p>I am passionate about helping people improve their lives through technology integration and education, musical enrichment, proper diet and exercise, spending time in the outdoors, financial responsibility, and breaking bad habits.  I am a current student at Nashville Software School preparing to become a web developer/software developer.  We are currently using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AngularJS, Grunt, Git, Bootstrap, and a host of other tools to build web apps.  I would like to use my knowledge, expertise, and enthusiasm to help others simplify and improve life in these modern times.</p>

            <h2>Tank U</h2>
            <p>A tower defense game where you play as the defensive captain of a team of turret commanders.  Using your resources carefully, you must defend from the incoming onslaught of tanks with their eyes set on destroying your home city.  For each enemy you defeat, you gain resources to strengthen you forces and hopefully save everyone from the brink of destruction.</p>
            <p>The game is built with Phaser.js.  The complexity of the game is the dynacism of the turrets.  They are set to rotate and fire at enemy tanks only when they are within a certain range.</p>

            <p>The Nashville recycling app is a set-it-and-forget-it style app for trash, recycling, and brush collection.  Set your valid Nashville address and you will be sent a push notification the night before your trash or recycling need to be out for pickup.  A notification for brush collection can be configured up to one week prior to the pickup date to allow time to gather leaves, sticks, brush, and trees for collection.</p>
